    <p><em>Meme Coin Backed by Student Housing Rental Income</em></p>
  </header>

  <section>
    <h2>Abstract</h2>
    <p>BoarderBucks (BDB) is a community-driven meme coin that funds the creation and operation of a student boarding house. The project combines crypto culture with real estate investment, offering a token tied to a real-world income stream.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Problem</h2>
    <p>Students face limited affordable housing options. Meanwhile, many meme coins lack real-world backing and long-term sustainability.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Solution</h2>
    <p>By launching BDB, we raise funds to acquire and operate a student boarding house projected to earn $900 per month net. Rental income will fuel ongoing buybacks of BDB tokens, creating a sustainable ecosystem.</p>

    <h2>Tokenomics</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Presale: 15% (150M BDB)</li>

    <h2>Use of Funds</h2>
    <p>Presale funds will cover property acquisition, renovation, furnishing, and initial operating expenses. A portion will seed DEX liquidity for smooth trading. Treasury funds are reserved for operations, maintenance, and potential expansion.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Buyback Mechanism</h2>
    <p>Once rental operations stabilize, 50% of net rental income will be used monthly to buy back BDB tokens from the open market. Purchased tokens will be burned or locked, supporting long-term token value.</p>
